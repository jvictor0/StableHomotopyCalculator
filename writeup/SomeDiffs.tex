\section{Some Differentials in the Adams Spectral Sequence}

We will now compute a few differentials for the Adams Spectral Sequence for spheres $p=2$.  
The results known to me are listed below, and these are the only results my software system uses to compute.

\begin{Theorem}
  The following relations hold in the Adams Spectral Sequence for spheres as $p=2$
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item for all $r$ and $x,y\in E_r$, we have
      \[d_r(xy)=d_r(x)y+xd_r(y)\]
    \item For $i=0,1,2$ or $3$, if $x\in E_2^{s,t+s}$ with $t=-1$ (mod $2^{i+1}$), then
      \[d_{2^i+1}(Sq_{2^i}x)=h_ix^2\]
  \end{enumerate}
\end{Theorem}
