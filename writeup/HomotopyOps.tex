We would like to define homotopy operations on the Adams Spectral Sequence.
Formally, these operations will share many properties with cohomology operations.  
In fact, though we don't use this, the adem relationship still holds.  
However, it is not the case that $Sq^0$ is the identity any more.  

We restrict here to the case of the Adams Spectral Sequence spheres for $p=2$.
Let $C_*$ be a $\A$-free resolution of $\Z/2$.  
All tensors are taken over $\Z/2$ unless otherwise noted.  


TODO: GENERALIZE!

Recall the cup product, and that it could be computed using a map 
\[\Delta_0:C_*\to C_*\otimes C_*\]
Let $\rho$ be the flipping map $C_*\otimes C_*\to C_*\otimes C_*$.  
Because $\A$ is co-commutative, $\rho$ restricted to $\Z/2\otimes \Z/2$ is the identity.
Since $\rho$ obviously commutes with the differentials, it is homotopic to the identity.
Thus $\rho\Delta_0\sim\Delta_0$, and we can call that homotopy $\Delta_1$.  

\begin{Lemma}[Luilevicius\cite{luiCycs}]
  For each $i$, there is a degree $i$ $\A$-chain map
  \[\Delta_i:C_*\to C_*\otimes C_*\]
  with
  \[\partial\Delta_i+\Delta_i\partial=\rho\Delta_{i-1}+\Delta_{i-1}\]
  Given two sequences $\Delta_i$ and $\Delta'_i$, for the least $i$ such that $\Delta_i\ne \Delta_i'$, $\Delta_i\sim\Delta_i'$.  
\end{Lemma}

\begin{mydef}
  Let $u\in Hom_\A^t(C_s,k)$ be a cocycle.  
  \[(u\cup_i u)(\sigma)=(u\otimes u)(\Delta_i\sigma)\]
  \[Sq_i([u])=Sq^{2s-i}([u])=u\cup_i u\]
\end{mydef}
Notice this is well defined when we pass to homology
